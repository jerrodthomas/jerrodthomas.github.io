            A BRIEF HISTORY OF SANFORD, COLORADO
            <br>
            1888 to 1952
            <br>
            by Lettie S. Jensen
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            <b>D</b>uring the colonization period sponsored by President Brigham Young and John Taylor after the removal of Latter-day Saints to the Rocky Mountains, the leaders were alert to find suitable locations for settlements in Utah and surrounding states. A sick detachment of the Mormon Batallion en route from Santa Fe, New Mexico to Pueblo Colorado, is credited as having been the first Mormons to look upon the San Luis Valley. They were favorably impressed with its possibilities, especially in the southern part.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            It was not until 1877 that  John Morgan, President of the Southern States Mission, wrote to President Brigham Young that many of the converts in the south desired to migrate to the Rocky Mountains. Brother Morgan asked advice as to a suitable location for them. New Mexico was on of the places under consideration for the project when President Young died. The matter continued through President John Taylor.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Lawrence M. Peterson, who was at this time living in New Mexico, had previously recommended the Conejos River area in the San Luis Valley to Erastus Snow as a suitable place to settle, stating, however, that the elevation is high, the winters long and the growing season short. James E. Stewart, an experienced colonizer, was sent from Salt Lake City to explore the Conejos region and his report to the Church Leaders was favorable. Saints from the south who had come as far as Pueblo and spent the winter began moving south to the Conejos area settling in Los Cerritos until the town of Manassa was laid out.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            In the summber of 1880, a number of families were called from Utah to this locality. Among those arriivvng here in the fall were the Heiselts, Ottertons, Poulsons, J.G. Cornum and Smiths, Thor N. Petersen and S.G. Berthelsen were early Manassa settlers. The journey took several weeks in covered wagons. Until homes were built, they pitched their tents about three miles south of p the present site of Sanford. Some lived through the winter in duggouts. But a settlement had commenced. Manassa had been laid out in 1879. These first two settlements were named Ephraim and Mannassa in honor of the two sons of JOseph. Chris J. Block and others came to Ephraim in 1881.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            In 1882, another settlement was made northeast of Ephraim when Jens Jensen, John Shawcroft, C.C. Frederiksen, the Cornums, Jim Nielsen and others came from Utah. They called the town Richfield because of the fertility of the soil.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Other settlers came to Ephraim. From the south were the Ree families, John White, Mack Cunningham, and John Jackson. Others from Utah were Jorgan Brady, Peter Rasmussen, Newotn Wilson. From Wisconsin were the Hutchins, Hosbutter, and Martin families who came later. Brigham J. Young came about 1884.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Ephraim and Richfield, however, were handicapped by damp soil. A bench with natural drainage lay between the two towns. The people from Ephraim and Richfield were encouraged to come to this higher location and many did. In 1888, a new ward was organized on the bench as it was called. Among the names suggested for the places were Union and Alma, but it was finaly given the name of Sanford in honor of the first Stake Presidet, Silas Sanford Smith, who was also known in the colonization of the San Jaun country in southern Utah. Silas S. Smith hepled to secure titles to the land here which was done through the state board in Denver. Favorable prices and long time payment plans were obtained for the new settlers.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Other Prominent in the early history of Sanford were Soren G. Berthleson and Thor E. Petersen. The latter with his sons, Sven and Peter, surveyed the town. Two irrigation canals, the Ephraim and the Sanford, were made to bring water from the Conejos River. Other early settlers in Sanford were the Haggard, Mullins, Becks, Valentines, Mortensens, Crowthers, Whitneys, Deckers and Mr. F. Reynolds.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            The settling of this new country was accompanied with many hardships.  Wood to bun and logs to build with had to be hauled by team a distance of forty miles or more, often while blizzards were sweeping the valley. Teamsters walked to keep from freezing as the wagons creekd over frozen snow. Crops sometimes froze in August during those trying years. The people had obeyed a call and they knew the Lord would open the way before them. They were happy. Among the settlers were musicians, builders, school teachers, nurses, masons and merchants.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Two meeting houses were built, first at Ephraim, then at Sanford. Ephraim's building was moved and joined to Sanfords, thus enlarging it for all community purpose, from a house of prayer to that of a theater, school and dance hall. Often each one took cake, sandwiches or other refreshments during the rest period of the dance. 
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Andrew Paulson built the first house with a shingled roof; Chrisand Boletta Block operated the first hotel; Albion Haggard and John Harrison were pioneer merchants until a co-op store was built. This was operated by Frank Crowther. Later it became the proerty of Sven Petersen who still owns and rents the building. Andrew Poulson also owned and operated a general store for a number of years. John and Ira Whitney and S.W. Hunt were pioneer blacksmiths. Mrs. Lars Mortensen, better known as "Aunt Cornalia," Mrs. Margaret Rasmussen, Mrs. Martha Carter and Mrs. Margaret Haskell were pioneer midwives.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Early teachers were MRs. A.P. Pealson, Ella Ottason, (now Mr.s John Rasmussen) Mrs. Christensen, George W. Irvin, and L. N. Mornensen. As the town progressed, better homes replaced the log cabins. A brick school house and a brick social hall were erected. Church was held in the new social hall as also were many dramatic productions by almost professional talent which was found among the residents.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            In the latter part of 1903, a new chapel was dedicated. It was built out of stone which was hauled by team from the west mountains. Jacob Peircy and Solomon Lloyd (who is still living at 100 years old this year, 1952) did the masonry and Alexander Tirrn, Wa. T. Morris and Holm A. Mortensen were skilled carpenters.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            The chapel was built with an alcove for the choir, behind and a little about the pulpit, at the time it was the finest chapel in Comejos County and Sanford's choir was considered the best in the Valley. The same was of Sanford's Brass Band. Leading musicians were Ms. T. Morris, Jens Mortensen, W.O. Crowther and Holm Mortensen.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Farming and stock raising gradually became the leading industry. The elevation of the Valley is 9,500 feet. Strawaberries, raspberries, currants and various kinds of apple thrive here and vegetables are of excellent quality both in flavor and texture. Hundresof cans of garden peas, potatoes, cabbage, lettuce, colliflower, sugar beets, etc. are shipped out of the Valley annually. all grains and alfalfa are harvested. Poultry, sheep, goats and cattle are raised in large numbers.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Coal, gas, oil, and electricity are used as fuel. Every home has its own emission well which furnisehs the household wit hpure cold water. The town was incorperated Sanford, it's school district NO. 6, erected a large school building only a few years  ago which  houses eighth grade and a achool. Built with a large gmnasium, its students have athletic honors in the state several times. There is also a teacherage with modern equipment near the school.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            A new $150,000 chapel was dedicated September 18, 1949 by Antoine R. Ivins of the First Council of the Seventy. It includes all class rooms for the various organizations and a super-lighted recreation hall, kitchen and all appliances. The building faces an oiled highway which runs through the main street.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            The climate has been greatly moderated since the early days of Sanford. There are very few days in the year, if any, that the sun does not shine. The refion is known far and wide as the "Sunny San Luis Valley." Here is a couplet, written by one of the few living pioneers of this city, Mrs. A.P. Poulson. "Our home town! Where the sun ust loves to shine; I"ll tell the world you are juse fine!"
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Beautiful canyons and streams lure many fishermen during the summer months. The Daughters of the Utah Pioneers, Blue Spruce Camphave erected a monument of pure Colorado granit weighing hundres of pounds, cut and hauled from the Salida Quarry, a distance of 100 miles and placed in honor of the pioneers of this community on the spot where the first log church stood. It sill stands to remind future generations of the solidatrity, dependability, strength, courage and fortitude of the pioneers. The following were members of the organization at the time  of its erection: Lettie S. Jensen, Leah B. Kirby, Irene McIntire, Caroline Vaentine, Marcell Crowther, Mary C. Poulson, Mama Petersen, Martha Rasmussen, Nellie Hutchins, Loretta Decker, Helen Mortensen, Amelia Poulsen and Sadie MOrtensen. Since the organization of the Sanford Ward the following bishops have served: S.C> Darthelsen, W.O. Crowther, James P. Jensen, John B Rand, Henry W. Valentine, Wm. ALma Crowther, Wilford G. Peterson, Ronald C. Johnson, Wilfred R. Morgan and Harvey L. Deem.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Sanford has a cheese factory, the building of which was strongly urged by Jared P.  Jensen who was a patron until his death in 1931. His daughter Melva, was chosen by the Frink Co. to break the first bottle of milk at it's christening.
