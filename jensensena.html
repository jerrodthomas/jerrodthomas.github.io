                <b>N</b>ielsena Katrina Jensen, or Sena as she was called, was born 23 June 1869 in Fountain Green, Utah to Jens Nielson Jensen and Mettie Kathrine Nielson. Sena, or Mama, was the youngest of three living children:
                <br />
                <i>Karen Maria Jensen</i> born 1858 in Belgrow, Denmark. Died 1862 with measles and was buried in at sea as they were sailing for America.
                <i>Karen Marie Jensen</i> born 2 February 1863 in Pleasant Grove, Utah.
                <i>James Chrstian Jensen</i> born 2 August 1865 in Fountain Green, Utah.
                <i>Nielsena Katrina Jesen</i> born 23 June 1869, died 27 June 1928 in Sanford, Colorado.

                When Mama was a young girl, the President of the church, Brigham Young, called a group of families to go as missionries to settle in Colorado. Her parents sold homes, etc., in Utah and traveled by covered wagons, putting what furniture and other things in these wagons. At age 14, Mama drove one of the wagons. There was quite a number of families tht made the journey. As I've been told, Mama made bread, but how and what kind? It was nothing to see the Indains turn up at any time. The Sints would give them food. They especially liked bread. Other Indians sighted were not so friendly, although they weren't bothered too much. Their journey ws long, hot and dusty. Many hardships occurred along the way. They finally arrived in the San Luis Valley of Colorado, first settling in Richfield about 1884. The ground was very marsh, too good for farming. So, in 1885, a better townsite opened up. It was called Sanford, fter the first stake president Silas Sanford. There were 140 families, population 650.

                In 1886, Mama and Daddy were married, and on 16 October 1890 went to the Manti Temple to have all their temple work done. Thier first home was in a log house on the est side of town. My sister Edna said Mama had it fixed up nice. She had hand woven rugs on the floor, and pretty curins. Mama always liked curtins, and of course, pots of flowers. Mama and Daddy had nine children: six boys and three girls. The oldest boy died in infancy, and a girl, Geneva Zetell died of dyptheria at the ge of nine. How many were born in the log house, I do not know. After grandather Jensen died, Aunt Maria moved in and took care of grandmother until they moved to Idaho. Then, Mama and family moved in and took care of her until she passed away in December 1911 at the age of 84. Mama was a very net and clean person. Very paticulary, everything had to be just so. She alwys wanted a thing glass or cup to drink from. I will always remember our noon lunches we had together. They were special to me.

                Mama always raised a large garden, and canned a lot of fruit and jellies, also pickles of all kinds. At that time, there was no way to preserve vegetables, but later they learned to dry green beans and corn. It was always fun to go to the garden with her, and grapple potatoes and gather vegetable for supper. We would wash them out at the water pump (had one of those hand pumps for water). I loved mother dearly. Another joy was when we cleaned house. We would put everything out in the yard. Add new straw in mattresses and feathers in others. How clean it would always smell. The old red brick house had 1- foot ceilings and they used calcimine on the walls.

                Mama always saw that we attended all our church meetings: Sunday School, Primary, etc. She and a neighbore, Old Granny Creamer, and another Danish woman were visiting teachers for years together. Alwys enjoyed listening to them talk in their Danish language. Mama was always ready and willing to help in the church in any way. Lay out the dead as was the custom at that time. Sena was a very good cook. Always had some kind of sweets as a desert after a meal. She used to make some form of cheese, but we never had this often. Very good. Most always at Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter, she would make her famous Danish beer. Mama would brown several pans of brley in the oven. We raised a lot of hops on the north side of the ice house. After boiling these two in cloth bags, she would strain into a tub, add sugar and yeast and put into a wooden keg and put in a cellar for about ten days. It was non-alchoholic, but very good. She would make a four layer walnut cake (walnuts were all we had at this time) at this time when friends or others dropped in. Bishop Valentine would drop by for some beer and cake. He was so good to Mama as well as to everyone. Mama was a very good cook, and if she ever used a cookbook I never saw one. Alas!

                One summer Mama, Edna, nd I went to Utah for General Conference and then on to Idaho Flls, Idaho to visit Aunt Marie (Mama's sister). We stayed there for a month. Mama and I came back through Utah where Mama used to live. Visited some relations and friends of hers. Edna stayed in Idaho with Aunt Maria. There she met and married Bob Kenney from Montana. This hurt Mama very much. Mama missed her very much. When Edna and Bob finally ame home, she was very much pregnant. Slim or Bob was a very likable person. We soon learned to love him. He was good to Mama. He brought her a beautiful black taffeta petticoat. Mama was so proud of this. She didn't have a lot of nice things. Her dresses were all very nice nd pretty (at this time dresses and clothing were long.) They used to call a slip a shimy. It would hve lace etc. across the top. Also wore a petticoat. All this to iron, and some was done on a table. Heting irons on the stove, Edna used the irnoing board. Oh yes, Mama always wore a big apron s they did at this time, with white or fance ones when they were visiting. Mama was a person that never complained. Although she had made the many problems t one time. I remember Mama was outside and made the mistake of bending down as old BIlly Goat butted nd knocked her down. After that, her back would crack when she walked. Although she said it didn't hurt. Edna said when she was younger, her feet and legs would swell and hurth with rheumatism. She suffered so much from this, but she got better until later years. I have sen her wade in the snow to go up to help Orpha when Maurice was sick. This made it worse before she passed away. Both hands were deformed from this disease. The right hand fingers were straight and forced back. She couldn't use the fingers at all. All she could use was the thumb and forefinger to eat. They had a transparent look. Daddy would put her to bed and bathe her. Orpha washed her hair. (Orpha was a daughter-in-law.) I would get her up, dress her and fix her hair. It was real long. A braid in back coiled around the back of her head. The front divded and rolled around the braid and pinned. Mama had a real nice chair she always sat in. I know how lonely and tiresome this was for her. She could walk some without help. In February, Mama and I went to Center to visit my sister. She complained of a hurgint in the navel. Bob was so good to her. He would bring things such as a favorite candy bar, grapes and cheese. She loved cheeses or other delicasies.

            <p class="text">
                Not too long after we came home, Mama took to bed for several months. Gradually getting worse, she suffered terribly. We found out after she passed away it was cancer. She passed away 27 June 1928 at her home. She was a darling mother. She taught me many things. Her faith was strong and never waivered, even when she was ill for so long. She loved her family very much.
