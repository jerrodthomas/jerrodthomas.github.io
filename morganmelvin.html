                <b>I</b> was born in Sanford, Colorado February 2, 1889 in the brick home of Grandpa Jensen, mother's father. My folks lived there until my dad could have the logs to build a home for us. The two room home was made of logs. Brother Lewis was born two years after me, then came Alva Laurence 2 years after him. Then came my sister Edna, Geneva. Edward came later when my folks moved into Grandpas home to take of Grandma Jensen. I was baptized in the Sanford Canal, when I was eight years old by Nels Heiselt and blessed by Brother Cornum, a member of the bishopric.

                I went to Primary a good many years. I was ordained a deacon when old enough and remained one until I was 16 or 17 years. I went with Andrew Rasmussen, Clara Johnson's father for a year or two. When about 17 years old, I was ordained a seventy never was a teacher or priest.

                The Church organized the San Luiz Academy The teacher was King Driggs, father of the King Sisters. I went to day school in an old log house across the street from Gene Barr's store. I was selected to become the Second Counselor in the Sunday School with Fred Christensen as Superintendent and Orval Peterson as First Counselor. I went to the Academy for four years. Where a graduate of BYU and his wife with Driggs I think. Now as I get older it was a guiding light had it not been for the training I received; probably would have taken up the cigarette habit which most of my playmates took up
