               As a boy in the summertime John William Morgan helped with the town herd of milk cows, as he was the only one of the boys that had a pony, so the boys would take turns riding it. They had to watch the cows as there were no fences, and the cows would stray away and the Indians would steal them. And it came to pass, that one day father was getting a drink of water from a nearby creek. As he raised up, to his surprise, there stood a big Indian, standing over him. Father was so scared that he ran away. The Indian ran the other way. Father went to school in the winter time and helped with the chores. Grandfather had some sheep, so father helped with them.

                A group of families were called, by Brigham Young, to go to the San Luis Valley in Colorado to start a settlement there. They went in covered wagons. As a young man Father rode on a horse, with some other men, as guides along the way. They were to watch for Indians. They saw quite a few, but the Lord was with them and they were not bothered. When father would get tired of riding his horse, he would get into one of the wagons with my Mother, who drove one. Her family was also one of the families, called to go to the San Luis Valley in Colorado. He also ate his meals with the family along the way. Later on he made two trips back to Utah. After the second trip he stayed in Colorado as two of his older brothers were already living there, so father lived with them.

                Daddy was a janitor at the Tivoli Theater, and also the schools for a number of years. Later, he was the water master for the north part of town. What fun it was as a child, I would go with him by horse and wagon up to the head of the Conejos River to check on water, etc. He taught me the names of many flowers, birds and edible weeds. He also made me a whistle out of a willow. Daddy and I would get mushrooms, fry them and eat them. Anything Daddy ate, I liked too.

               In 1886 father married Nielsena, "Sena" Catherine Jensen, my mother. They had been sweethearts since childhood. They were married in Sanford, Conejos, County, Colorado. They were later sealed to each other in the Manti Temple on 16 of October 1890. They had nine children. They raised seven of us, as two of their children died. There were six boys and three girls. The oldest little boy, James Thomas, only lived a few days. My sister Geneva Morgan died when she was only ten years old, with diphtheria. We sure did miss her. Father was a good man and a good provider.
