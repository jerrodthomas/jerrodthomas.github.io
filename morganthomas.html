                    THOMAS MORGAN
                </b>
            </h2>
            <p class="text">
                <b>M</b>y third great-grandfather, Thomas Morgan was born on 23 May 1830 in Forest of Dean, Gloucester, England. On 25 March 1855, he married Frances “Fannie” Vizzard.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                When Thomas was two, his mother married Edward Coleman, who was killed in a coal mining accident when Thomas was nine. Because of this, he went to work at the age of nine, but this didn’t seem to help their financial matters, so when his brother George turned ten, he went to work for a man as a servant for four years. Thomas’ mother Elizabeth remarried again, and during this time they were introduced to the Church. Shortly after this his brother, Thomas made a visit to his brother George at Edge Lodge, and told him about the restored gospel. George came home sick, and was administered to by the Elders. They asked him if he believed that a prophet had been called, and he said yes and was administered to, and healed right then. George was baptized on the following Sunday, 14 February 1850.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                In May 1854, Thomas’ mother, two sisters, stepfather and an uncle died. On 7 December 1854, aboard a ship called The Clara Wheeler to come to America. A man named, Henry E. Phelps presided over a company of about 421 saints. It was on this voyage that Thomas married Frances.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                On 11 February 1855, the ship landed in New Orleans, and the took a steamboat to St. Louis. They made use of the Perpetual Emigration Fund and arrived in Salt Lake on 24 October 1855 by handcart, which was a year before the Willie and Martin Handcart company.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                The only other thing that I know about Thomas, is that he served as a private in the Utah Militia during the Indian War On 22 November 1908, he died in Fountain Green, Sanpete, Utah.
